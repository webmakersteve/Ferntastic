# 6/5
Worked with formatting.php to add functions
Theme-ified the HTML

# 10/24
Made significant edits to the code. Significant
1. MySQL module has been changed from procedural style to Object style. Is now MySQLEngine class
	1. Other library items like sites and fquery need to be edited significantly to take advantage of this change
	2. As a failsafe, deprecated should be updated to include all of the old functions so we can take note
	   of where they are being used and correct them
2. Instituted an MVC framework
3. Controller.php, Model.php, etc. have been added

# 10/25
First working app has been made. /patsys
1. Files controller added and essentially implemented. All files in the hidden files directory are now controlled
	1. Implementation of safe file access can be easily now done by editing the controller
	
# 10/26
Several changes where made to get it closer to production level code
1. fQuery has been changed to reduce amount of code and increase extensibility.
2. fQuery now has support for the new MySQL framework. It must make use of the default database 
	by saying fQuery::$useDatabase = MySQLi Resource ID
3. Changes have been reverted to try to "smart check" for controllers which are not made to
	handle more than one type of request. Routes will now be used to compensate for this 
4. Config data now given to all helper classes
5. More extensive helper class support. 
6. Themer has been created
	1. Themer is a class that is designed to help use parent-child relationships for views and regions.
	2. Block support to come
	3. Themer will also help output data to the pages within context. For example, stylesheets loaded
7. A lot more great stuff
